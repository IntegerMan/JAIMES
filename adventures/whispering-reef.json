  "name": "The Whispering Reef",
  "author": "Matt Eland",
  "version": "0.0.0.1",
  "ruleset": "DND5E",
  "backstory": "The player character is a crewmember of a smuggling vessel, The Silver Minnow, which was transporting illicit magical cargo through an isolated shipping lane. Without warning, a freak storm struck near an island that does not appear on any charts. The character wakes alone at the edge of this mysterious landmass, with no sign of the crew or their ship—only fragments of wreckage scattered among strange black coral. The character remembers little of the crash, and the environment is immediately unsettling: unnatural symbols, discordant wildlife, and a sensation that the island itself is watching. From the beginning, the island's ominous quiet hints that something more than survival is at stake.",
  "settingDescription": "The island is small, no more than a few miles across, covered in dense jungle and jagged stone ridges. Its shoreline is ringed by strange black coral that glows faintly under moonlight. In the jungle's heart rises a half-collapsed watchtower, barely visible above the canopy. The sounds here are not normal—waves echo oddly, birdsong skips like a broken music box, and deep underwater calls sometimes vibrate through the stone itself. Faint trails suggest you are not alone.",
  "locationsOverview": "The island offers five distinct, atmospheric locations that facilitate exploration, player decision-making, and emergent storytelling. The Wreck Site serves as the entry point, blending survival tension with immediate environmental storytelling and low-stakes danger. The Jungle Shack introduces backstory clues, cult symbolism, and class-friendly challenges. The Ritual Cave is the central plot hub, designed for a pivotal encounter with layered outcomes—combat, stealth, or eldritch consequences. The Collapsed Watchtower functions as a non-combat lore site, offering elevation, foreshadowing, and hints at a deeper history. Finally, the Reef Circle introduces the island's latent eldritch presence, offering a dreamlike experience or magical effect disconnected from combat but rich with mystery and future hooks. These locations allow the GM to control pacing and tone while subtly escalating the horror and intrigue.",
  "locations": [
    {
      "name": "Wreck Site",
      "description": "The player awakens on a rocky shoreline surrounded by scattered debris from their ship. The beach is cluttered with crates, broken wood, and unnatural black coral formations. A steep slope leads into the jungle. Symbols carved into the coral suggest intelligent design. This location serves as the adventure's starting point and offers early opportunities for investigation, recovery, and tension building."
    },
    {
      "name": "Collapsed Watchtower",
      "description": "A mossy stone structure, barely standing above the jungle canopy, offers a vantage point and a cryptic view of the island. Inside are half-destroyed carvings that show similar spiral motifs as those near the wreck. This site hints at an older civilization and connects to future plot arcs, but holds no current inhabitants."
    },
    {
      "name": "Ritual Cave",
      "description": "At low tide, a coral-choked cave near the waterline becomes accessible. The cave glows with faint bioluminescence and contains a circular tidepool at its center. The stone surfaces pulse with a subtle rhythmic vibration. This location is the focal point of the kobold cult's ritual, and it provides space for a significant confrontation, magical weirdness, and pivotal choices."
    },
    {
      "name": "Jungle Shack",
      "description": "A half-collapsed ship repurposed into a crude shelter lies about a mile inland. The structure contains an old sailor's journal, crude sleeping arrangements, and signs of recent use. There are signs of kobold presence—masks, small footprints, and strange symbols. The shack includes hidden compartments and a chance to piece together the cult's purpose."
    },
    {
      "name": "Reef Circle",
      "description": "A natural tidepool ring formed of black coral sits exposed during low tide on the island's western edge. The water in the center never drains, and the coral hums faintly when approached. The closer one gets, the stronger the pull to gaze into the center. The area can serve as a trigger for visions, dreamlike states, or interaction with otherworldly forces, including portable encounters or longer arc setups."
    }
  ],
  "encountersOverview": "The included encounters support multiple play styles and emphasize class-specific engagement—stealth, observation, tools, and choice-driven progression. The Crab Swarm offers a low-stakes, introductory combat or avoidance puzzle early on. The Kobold Patrol introduces intelligent adversaries and gives the player room to use deception, stealth, or ambush. The Trapped Drawer serves as an interactive object-based hazard, reinforcing careful exploration and providing a powerful but eerie item. The Ritual encounter is the climax of the adventure, designed to be flexible: players may fight, interrupt stealthily, or allow it to unfold for weird consequences. The Vision of the Deep is a portable narrative event that can be dropped anywhere—especially at the Reef Circle or during rest—offering insight, foreshadowing, or subtle mechanical effects. Together, these encounters give the GM narrative control points and pacing variety, allowing for a light but effective solo mystery with optional eldritch horror undertones.",
  "encounters": [
    {
      "name": "Crab Swarm",
      "description": "A group of oversized, aggressive crabs has nested in one of the overturned crates at the wreck site. They attack if disturbed but can be avoided with a careful approach or bait. This simple combat encounter introduces risk and rewards clever observation."
    },
    {
      "name": "Kobold Patrol",
      "description": "A trio of kobolds moves through the jungle wearing glowing body paint and seaweed masks. They are alert but erratic, sometimes arguing with voices only they can hear. The player may engage them directly, sneak past, or try to deceive or intimidate them. They carry small relics and clues about the ritual's location."
    },
    {
      "name": "The Ritual",
      "description": "In the coral cave, the kobold cult performs a ritual to open a portal to an unknown dimension. The encounter includes 3–4 kobolds and a kobold cultist leader. The player can disrupt, stealthily sabotage, or allow the ritual to proceed. If the ritual is completed, strange light fills the cave and something glimpsed from beyond the veil may leave a mark on the player."
    },
    {
      "name": "Trapped Drawer",
      "description": "Inside the jungle shack, a drawer within a repurposed writing desk contains a glowing coral idol. The drawer is trapped with a simple needle trap (poisoned). Disarming it requires a Thieves' Tools check; triggering it causes minor damage and confusion effects. The idol may whisper unintelligible phrases when held near water."
    },
    {
      "name": "Visions of the Deep",
      "description": "Triggered by prolonged contact with the coral idol or interaction with the Reef Circle, the player experiences a hallucination or dream-like vision. A massive cyclopean eye opens in black water, watching silently. This can offer cryptic guidance, inflict a psychic condition (e.g., fear, disadvantage on Insight), or mark the player for future influence. It is not tied to any one location."

  "gameMasterNotes": "Pacing: The full adventure is designed for 1–2 hours of solo play but can be shortened by omitting one location or streamlined to a central path (Wreck → Jungle Shack → Ritual Cave).\n\nDifficulty: Avoid prolonged combat. Most threats should be skippable, avoidable, or resolvable through skills. The final encounter should be tense but fair, with room for both success and creative failure.\n\nTone: Keep the horror elements atmospheric and whimsical—this is a player's story of isolation and mystery, not despair. Let the strange coral and kobold cult be eerie, not gruesome.\n\nResolution: The session should end after the ritual—whether stopped, disrupted, or completed. Leave the outcome ambiguous or plant a clear hook for a follow-up adventure (e.g., the coral idol whispers, something follows them off the island, or the sea calls again).",
  "narrativeStructure": "The Whispering Reef is a three-act solo adventure that balances exploration, stealth-focused challenge, and light eldritch horror. The player controls a Level 1 characters and should be encouraged to engage with their core skill set.\n\nAct I – Shipwreck and Survival\nThe character begins at the Wreck Site, scavenging supplies and encountering the first danger in the form of a crab swarm. This is a low-risk encounter meant to introduce risk/reward thinking and foreshadow the unnatural state of the island. The Game Master should provide subtle environmental clues (e.g., spiral coral symbols, broken cargo with magical markings) and gently encourage movement inland via visible landmarks or auditory cues like distant chanting or glowing lights.\n\nGM Directive: Keep initial challenges straightforward and short. Focus on atmosphere and small discoveries rather than combat. Offer clear paths forward without overwhelming choice.\n\nAct II – Discovery and Tension\nAs the character enters the jungle, they reach the Jungle Shack, where they can uncover clues about a kobold cult through journals, symbols, and strange artifacts. The player may encounter kobold patrols—an opportunity to showcase stealth, deception, or ambush tactics. A trapped drawer encounter encourages tool use and presents the Coral Idol, which becomes a recurring mystical element.\n\nGM Directive: Escalate tension by blending discovery with subtle threat. Use kobold behavior to build anticipation of the ritual, and allow the player to gather momentum without feeling lost. Offer advantages for clever use of class features.\n\nAct III – The Ritual\nThe final act takes place at the Ritual Cave, where kobolds are actively performing a ritual. The player may choose to engage directly in combat, sabotage the ritual from the shadows, or allow the ritual to proceed and observe the consequences. This is the adventure's climax and should feel meaningful but manageable for a Level 1 character. Encourage creativity—there are multiple valid ways to resolve the situation.\n\nGM Directive: Scale the encounter based on player condition and pacing. Reduce kobold count or offer environmental advantages if the character is low on resources. The goal is tension and narrative payoff, not a deadly gauntlet.\n\nOptional Areas and Encounters\nThe Reef Circle can be visited at any point for a vision or eldritch experience.\n\nThe Collapsed Watchtower provides atmosphere and foreshadowing but no major challenges.\n\nThe Vision of the Deep may be triggered during rest or interaction with the idol and can be used to seed future storylines or end the session on a haunting note."
