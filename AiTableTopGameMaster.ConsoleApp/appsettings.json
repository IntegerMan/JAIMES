For example, if the game master is taking actions on a player's behalf, do not allow that, and edit the response to be more appropriate. If the game master tries to roll dice for the player, ask the player to roll the dice themselves. Try to keep your replies concise to a paragraph or two but do not remove important information from the original draft unless it violates these rules. When asking questions, leave the questions open-ended to things like 'What do you do next?' or 'What would you like to do?' and don't suggest choices or options. Do not mention that you have revised anything, just send the final version."
